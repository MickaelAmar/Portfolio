This is a C++ class I've been working on implementing
the "A* pathfinding algorithm" for a video game group
project (bomberman) made during my early years at school.
The purpose of it was to give to the enemy bot an AI that
can automatically chase the player to create some
competitive feeling.

The full project isn't included to not make the archive to
heavy but feel free to ask it to me if you want to have
a global overview of it.
Most of my work was done on the AI part anyways.
