The code implements a small algorithm trying to determine the solution
of this problem.

This text below is the answer I submitted to Jaehan Lee :

About the question, the answer seems to depend of the size of
grid and if it has a limit or not.
Since it's not mentionned in the question itself, I assume it
is infinite and the cat can access to an infinite number of coordinates.
For example let's consider this : (100000000000,990000000000).
Assuming again that the grid has no limit, this is still an
accessible coordinate for the cat which means that this pattern
can be repeated infinitely as long as the sum of the digits aren't exceeding 19.
But I still made some tests of my own with a limited grid size (99x99)
and I came to the results that for sum limit of 19, the cat can
access 5995 points.
I think it's following what is called the Pascal's Triangle pattern.
Please, let me know what you think of this answer and/or should
the question you should be interpreted if you think I'm wrong.
