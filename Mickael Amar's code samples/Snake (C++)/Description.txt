Another video game project (snake game) made by a team
of 3 developers including me.
I mostly worked on the gameplay part (check Game,
Snake and Food classes).
The special feature of this project is that the gameplay
part and the graphic part are seperable. Therefore,
any graphic library can be plugged to the gameplay
part which will still works.
