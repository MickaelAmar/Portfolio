The second one is a sample from an intranet/backoffice
project I worked on at my last company in France, Axis.
This is a tool that can generate a Datatable generically
after selecting a table name from a database using Ajax.
I find this being a very convenient tool to build quick
admin interfaces.
Please note that it was developed using native PHP and in
accordance of the full project context.
I don't think I would use native PHP again for this kind
of project to be honest.
