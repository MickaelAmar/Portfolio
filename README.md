# Overview

A sample of mini projects using various tech I use to share as a portfolio to anybody curious!

Those are far from perfect as they were developped in different contexts usually where I was not proficient with the technologies yet. 

Therefore, I got plenty of room to improve those and feedbacks are greatly welcomed of course! 

# Projects' description

## NodeJS Simple Chat (NodeJS)

A simple Nodejs project that implements a basic auth/register form and a real time chat using express.js, socket.io and mongodb.
This is a very small project that helped me to learn the basics of nodejs in a weekend.


## Generic Table Viewer (Javascript)

The second one is a sample from an intranet/backoffice project I worked on at my last company in France, Axis. This is a tool that can generate a Datatable generically after selecting a table name from a database using Ajax. I find this being a very convenient tool to build quick back-offices.

Please note that it was developed using native PHP and in accordance of the full project context. I don't think I would use native PHP again for this kind of project to be honest.

Datatable's website : https://datatables.net/

## AStar_AI (C++)

This is a C++ class I've been working on implementing the "A* pathfinding algorithm" for a video game group project (bomberman) made during my early years at school.
The purpose of it was to give to the enemy bot an AI that can automatically chase the player to create some competitive feeling.

The full project isn't included to not make the archive to heavy but feel free to ask it to me if you want to have a global overview of it.
Most of my work was done on the AI part anyways.

## Snake (C++)

Another video game project (snake game) made by a team of 3 developers including me. I mostly worked on the gameplay part (check Game, Snake and Food classes).
The special feature of this project is that the gameplay part and the graphic part are seperable. Therefore, any graphic library can be plugged to the gameplay part which will still works.
